presentation on version numbering release version

semantic versioning
	definition
		major.minor.patch-hotfix
current process
	step:
		release process triggered
		commit is picked
		commit is versioned
proposal
	step:
		release process triggered
		dev decided to release next commit
		dev version the source code
		dev merge commit to master
		dev tag commit with version that is defined in source code
	pros:
		shifting commit picking process from devops to dev -> empower dev team
		enable automatic build versioning instead of the current datetime tag -> reduce potential error when choosing build to deploy
	cons:
		human-dependent, require dev team to manually tag the commit with version number
